Classifying Pneumonia X-rays from Kaggle

As part of the Image Processing course for the msc in Data Science in the University of Athens, we performed some analysis and trained classifiers for the following kaggle dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia/discussion

In the notebook there is the full work, with data exploration and visualization, image preprocessing, training LR, SVC, RF with CV, a custom CNN and utilizing transfer learning on DenseNet121, comparing and interpeting the results.
